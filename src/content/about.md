Hello ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for taking time to visit my website!

My name is Abhisek Mazumdar. I am currently working at [Dropsolid](https://dropsolid.com) as a Drupal & Mautic Engineer.

I am a full-stack developer. I began my career with Drupal and now design and implement end-to-end AI-enabled products using PHP, JavaScript, and WebOps. At Dropsolid, I work with a talented team focused on making AI enabled Digital Experience(DXP) accessible and practical for a wide range of users.

I am an openâ€‘source advocate and contributor with practical experience in Drupal, Mautic, WordPress, and the surrounding ecosystems. Beyond code contributions, I participate in community events such as DrupalCon, DrupalCamp, and local meetups. You may have seen me at recent conferences like DrupalCon Singapore (2024) [as a speaker](https://events.drupal.org/singapore2024/session/what-why-and-when-recipes-distributions-starshot) and Atlanta (2025) as volunteers.

Next, I plan to attend DrupalCon Nara 2025. Feel free to get in touch with me via [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhisekmazumdar/).

I am an active member of the Drupalers Association Pune ([drupalpune.in](https://www.drupalpune.in/)). We regularly organise meetups, you can find upcoming events on our Meetup page: [meetup.com/pune-drupal-group](https://www.meetup.com/pune-drupal-group/).
